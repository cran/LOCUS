Description: To decompose symmetric matrices such as brain connectivity matrices so that one can extract sparse latent component matrices and also estimate mixing coefficients, a blind source separation (BSS) method named LOCUS was proposed in Wang and Guo (2023) <arXiv:2008.08915>. For brain connectivity matrices, the outputs correspond to sparse latent connectivity traits and individual-level trait loadings.
